# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 6, 2019 
##### my first log! :)

**Today's Progress**: Signed up to GitHub, completed the "Hello World" project to set up my first repository, learnt about master, branches, pull and commit, and well as what the * "fork a repo" means! Also did just that - forked this repo :)

**Thoughts:** I'm really excited to start the #100 Days of Code Challenge; using GitHub myself after all these years of my devs using it, amazing feeling!
