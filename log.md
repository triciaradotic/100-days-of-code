# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 6, 2019 
##### my first log! :)

**Today's Progress**: Signed up to GitHub, completed the "Hello World" project to set up my first repository, learnt about master, branches, pull and commit, and well as what the * "fork a repo" means! Also did just that - forked this repo :)

**Thoughts:** I'm really excited to start the #100 Days of Code Challenge; using GitHub myself after all these years of my devs using it, amazing feeling!

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
